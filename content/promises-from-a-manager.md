# Promises from a Manager

1. We will have a weekly 1:1. I will never cancel this meeting, but you can cancel it whenever you like. It is your time.
2. Our 1:1 agenda will be in the meeting invite so we remember important topics. You are always free to use the time for whatever is on your mind.  
3. When I schedule a meeting with you, I will always say *when I schedule it* what it is meant to be about. I will not schedule meetings without an agenda.
4. When I drop into your DM’s, I will always say “hi and why.” No suspense, no small talk while you are wondering what I want.
5. News or announcements that significantly impact you, your work, or your team will come from me directly in a 1:1, not revealed in a big meeting.
6. You will get feedback from me when it is fresh. There will be no feedback in your performance review that you are hearing for the first time.
7. I trust you to manage your own time. You do not need to clear with me in advance your time AFK or OOO.
8. Your work gets done your way. My focus is on outcomes, not output. Once we are clear on where we need to go, how to get there is up to you. If I ever find it necessary to suggest a specific approach, I will supply an example.
9. A team is strongest when it is working together, looking after one another, and taking care of each other. Please look to your left and to your right for opportunities to help your colleagues. Please ask for help when you need it. Nobody works alone.
10. I trust you to skip level and talk to my manager or other senior management about anything you feel is relevant. You do not need to clear it with me, and I am not going to get weird about it when you do.
11. I will attribute credit appropriately to you and your team. I will never exaggerate my own role or minimize your contribution. I will be especially certain to nail down attribution when senior management are hearing of our accomplishments.

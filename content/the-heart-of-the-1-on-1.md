**Wellness**

* Are you safe and well? 
* You need not disclose personal information
* I am here to listen, especially if work is impacting your well-being
* Do you feel physically and psychologically safe? 
* You will not be humiliated, ignored, blamed or punished for asking questions
* Is your work/life balance compatible with your mental health?

**Readiness**

* Are you set up to succeed? 
* Do you have what you need to meet your goals? 
* Do you have a clear understanding of what those are? 
* What resources* might I provide that could help you be successful?
* Material, organizational, or even just help and advice

**Obstacles**

* What is standing in your way? 
* How can I help identify and clear obstacles to your progress? 
* Let us talk about anything that is slowing you down
* Let us talk about anything that could speed you up

**Recognition**

* Since we last met, what did you accomplish that you feel good about? 
* No achievement is too small 
* Let us mark down every win as we go, while they are fresh

**Feedback**

* How I am doing as your manager? 
* I will regularly share my feedback with you
* Let us break the ancient tradition of saving up a year of feedback to drop in a single psychologically devastating bomb, often timed thoughtfully to coincide with the holiday season.
